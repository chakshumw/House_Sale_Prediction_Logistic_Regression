# House Sale Prediction with Logistic Regression

This project uses **logistic regression** to predict whether a house will sell based on various features like price, size, location, and more. The goal is to apply machine learning techniques to real estate data for predictive analysis.

## Features:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, encode categorical data, and scale features.
- **Logistic Regression Model**: Predict the probability of a house selling based on input features.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
- **Visualizations**: Visualize data distributions, model performance, and decision boundaries.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Setup:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-sale-prediction.git
   ```
2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook House_Sale_Prediction_Logistic_Regression.ipynb
   ```

## Usage:
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning to real estate analysis, and you can modify the features or model for further experimentation or improvement.
